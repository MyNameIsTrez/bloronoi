/*
Explanation:

Updating every pixel cell when their seed gets updated is extremely slow.
The trick is that when a 2x2 group of cells all have the same parent, you can just inspect and update their parent.
Any cell either stores its pixel seed index, LOOK_AT_PARENT, or LOOK_AT_CHILDREN.
Initialize each grid cell to LOOK_AT_PARENT.
Initialize grids[0][0] with the first seed_index.
"if (grid[0][0] == LOOK_AT_PARENT) grid[0][0] = seed_index;" is probably needed to let the first seed be placed.
Grid cells should only have their seed updated if the distance to the new seed is shorter.
Don't draw squares if their cell's old seed has the same color as the new seed.
