Example:

In this grid, a cell that contains two red (R) seeds and two green (G) seeds
gets completely absorbed by a new, blue (B) seed. Those red and green pixels are set to LOOK_AT_PARENT,
and their parent to the blue seed's index (That parent cell may however be set to LOOK_AT_PARENT as well).
The level indices are displayed at the top.
P stands for LOOK_AT_PARENT and C for LOOK_AT_CHILDREN.

Larger example where the grid starts out empty:
0 1  2    3
P PP PPPP PPPPPPPP
  PP PPPP PPPPPPPP
     PPPP PPPPPPPP
     PPPP PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP

Has a seed placed at index 9:
0 1  2    3
9 PP PPPP PPPPPPPP
  PP PPPP PPPPPPPP
     PPPP PPPPPPPP
     PPPP PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP
          PPPPPPPP

And then has a seed placed at index 63 (denoted with a - instead of 63):
0 1  2    3
C 9C PP99 PPPPPPPP
  CC PP9C PPPPPPPP
     99C- PPPPPP9-
     9C-- PPPPPP--
          PPPP9-PP
          PPPP--PP
          PP9-PPPP
          PP--PPPP

These levels can then be uncompressed to get this voronoi diagram:
99999999
99999999
9999999-
999999--
99999---
9999----
