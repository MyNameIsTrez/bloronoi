# bloronoi

Bloronoi is an algorithm that I came up with that:
1. Efficiently generates [blue noise](https://blog.demofox.org/2018/01/30/what-the-heck-is-blue-noise/) coordinates.
2. Efficiently [voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) floodfills, using the blue noise coordinates as seeds.

If you just want to generate blue noise efficiently, you can simply not draw the voronoi floodfilled areas. But keep in mind that even though you may not be drawing the voronoi floodfilled areas, it is inherent to the algorithm's data structure and so will still happen.

If you just want to do voronoi floodfilling efficiently, you can provide seed coordinates to use instead. The blue noise seed coordinates you normally get with bloronoi are just generated by picking a random cell within the largest voronoi area.
